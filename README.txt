Setting: 2nd/3rd year students,  university in a large city, mc lives in an apartment. Work in a group

Plot: 
Kinda cloudy might eventually turn into a storm. 
There’s something twisted about someone you know. Turns creepy later (maybe) 
(or/and) society is messed up 

Characters:
Moom Sekiranun (mc)
Taylor Kyūsū (loves calculus)



Ideas:
MC daydreaming (having a different outline clouds)


Potential conversations:

“hmm im thinking
of some funny potential scenarios.
and one stupid idea is like the mc having a conversation with someone and mentioning why they don't do this.
then the other char is like whats that? (something that exists irl but not the game)
then the mc is like oh right it doesn't exist (then they have some tohught process to themselves about breaking the 4th wall)”
