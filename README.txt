Setting: 2nd/3rd year students,  university in a large city, mc lives in an apartment. Work in a group

Plot: 
"sekiranun" a type of cloud that might eventually turn into a supercell. 
There’s something twisted about someone you know. Turns creepy later (maybe) 
(or/and) society is messed up (copying p5r group idk or maybe some other VN), 

Characters:
Moom (Momo *moo-mmm*) Sekiranun



Ideas:
MC does daydreaming.
Lives in an apartment on the 9th floor.
Psychology aspect suppose?
 


Potential conversations:

“hmm im thinking
of some potential scenarios.
and one idea is like the mc having a conversation with someone and mentioning why they don't do this.
then the other char is like whats that? (something that exists irl but not the game)
then the mc is like oh right it doesn't exist "(then they have some thought process to themselves about breaking the 4th wall "not reference to animes whatsoever")”
